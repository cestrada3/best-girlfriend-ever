            <h1> How Did I Get Sooooo Lucky</h1>
            <p> I never thought I'd fall for someone like this. I never thought someone sooo smart, caring, and sexyyyy could actually want something with me </p>
            <p> It's so crazy how we got to know eachother, but we found eachother for a reason. And I just got a feeling that time will show it was for a good reason</p>
            <p> Now that you are mine, I never want to stop trying to do everything I can to make you as happy as you make me. I want to figure out every little thing that makes you feel comfortable</p>
            <p> My feelings for you get stronger every day, and I do not see them going anywhere ever. </p>
            <p> I can not wait to get so comfortable with you and tell you everything that is on my mind. </p>
            <p> I just want to grow mentally, physically, and financially with you. I feel like the two of us together can do so many great things togther.</p>
            <p> I never want to lose this. I never want to lose you. </p>
