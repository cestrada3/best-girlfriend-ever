            <h1> How Did I Get Sooooo Lucky </h1>
            <p> I never thought I'd fall for someone like this but it's just like my guy Jermaine said, " I guess I found you for a reason, Only time could tell." </p>
            <p> I just want to do everything I can to make you as happy as you make me. </p>
            <p> My feelings for you get stronger every day, and I do not see them going anywhere ever. </p>
            <p> I can not wait to get get so comfortable with you with you.</p>
            <p> I just want to grow mentally, physically, and financially.</p>
